# DRIVE — execute the open skills safety and correctness backlog

**Scope:** the 29 GitHub issues enumerated in
`docs/specs/backlog-execution-plan.md` (#30–#66, exact set in that plan); the
Beads graph created from the reviewed plan will be the ONLY work this drive may
take.
**Phase:** SHAPE · **Bead:** n/a (polish returned gaps to plan space)
· **Branch:** `plan/backlog-execution`
**Pending:** —
**Gate:** `./check.sh`
· last green 2026-08-12 on the `10c0288` tree (exit 0).

## Done

- Queried all 29 open GitHub issues and confirmed that this repository has no
  initialized Beads store.
- Reconciled umbrellas, overlaps, priorities, dependencies, and parallel work
  lanes.
- Replaced the stale PR #64 drive record with this newly authorized goal.
- Installed the portable working agreement for subsequent implementers and
  panels.
- Passed the SHAPE hard stop: `codex review --base master` with
  `gpt-5.6-sol`/`xhigh` reported no P0/P1 findings at `bceb919`. Its two P2
  hardening observations (startup-watchdog group cancellation and defensive
  fixture orphan cleanup) remain non-blocking follow-up evidence for the
  admission-integrity stream.
- Ran the repository gate at `bceb919`: `./check.sh` exited 0 (26 installer,
  124 bot-gate, and 66 drive-status fixtures passed).
- Initialized Beads and transferred all 33 reviewed rows with 22 dependency
  edges; the first transfer audit found the exact expected labels, priorities,
  URLs, bodies, and ready A1 (`skills-ro5`).
- GRAPH polish then found that several lower workstream rows copied real intent
  but not enough API, failure, recovery, or fixture detail to be executable by a
  fresh agent. Per the GRAPH escalation rule, returned to SHAPE rather than
  encoding implementation guesses downstream.
- Repeated pinned Codex xhigh reviews drove the canonical gate wrapper to
  fail-closed process-group, output, cleanup, and inherited-signal behavior.
  `./check.sh` exited 0 on the `10c0288` tree (26 installer, 124 bot-gate, and 70
  drive-status fixtures passed).
- Called Fable at high effort to review the complete `docs/specs` inventory. It
  read all 33 rows and found two blocking plan gaps: B2d lacked its B2c
  serialization/artifact edge, and E3 relied on an unattested `br sync --status
  --json` schema. The plan now adds that edge, pins the measured `br 0.2.19`
  schema/hash, and incorporates the valid lower-severity corrections.

## Now

Re-run both the pinned Codex xhigh SHAPE review and the user-requested Fable
all-specs review against the corrected plan. Preserve the reviewed 33-row flat
graph and update its intentional dependency set from 22 to 24 edges only after
both reviewers have no blocking findings.

## Next

Return to GRAPH → update/polish/audit the 33 beads → land the planning/bootstrap
branch → start A1, GitHub issue #42, through rb-lite → continue the
highest-priority unblocked lane while respecting the two human-authority
checkpoints.

## Open questions for the human

- Before B1 BUILD: choose between refusing unsupported dirty delegated paths
  (recommended: disposable worktree plus fail-closed refusal) and supporting
  dirty in-scope preservation through the larger snapshot mechanism. This is a
  user-state/data-loss design checkpoint.
- Before F2 release: authorize publishing the required upstream rb-lite release.
  Opening and reviewing its branch/PR may proceed; publishing the release may not.
  Once authorized, the coordinating skills agent performs and verifies the
  mechanical publication—human authority does not require the human to run the
  release commands.
